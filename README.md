# Draughts

For this project, I was tasked with creating a piece of software using Python that included loops, branching, data structures and file handling and any further advanced features. As I had not made a game before, I decided to test myself and make a game using Pygame libraries. I implemented the basic ruleset of Draughts and used a tutorial to create a user interface that allows a person to play against another person on a local machine.
